  "summary": "Most core requirements appear implemented: domain suffix selector with exact options, paid plugins tab with a large catalog, and a simulated 3-method purchase dialog with per-server ownership persisted via server model + localStorage normalization. However, the diff summary is truncated in key areas, so some acceptance-criteria items cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence (notably installation gating until owned, and the presence of a recharge-style direct-payment UI beyond a simple confirm action).",

      "requirement": "If an owned paid plugin supports installation in the UI, installation is disabled/blocked until owned (and enabled once owned).",
      "reason": "PluginsPage.tsx is truncated before the paid plugins card rendering/installation actions, so it’s not possible to verify that installation is blocked for unowned paid plugins and enabled after purchase.",
